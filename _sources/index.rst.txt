Model Agnostic Interpretation with Skater documentation!
=======================================

Skater is a open source python package for model agnostic interpretation of predictive models. With Skater, you can unpack the internal mechanics of arbitrary models; as long as you can obtain inputs, and use a function to obtain outputs, you can use Skater to learn about the models internal decision criteria.

The package was originally developed by Aaron Kramer and Pramit Choudhary at DataScience.com to help enable data scientists provide model insights to team members and 3rd parties.
