PyInterpret
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PyInterpret is a python package for model agnostic interpretation of predictive models. With PyInterpret, you can unpack the internal mechanics of arbitrary models; as long as you can obtain inputs, and use a function to obtain outputs, you can use PyInterpret to learn about the models internal decision criteria.
